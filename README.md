**Social defeat models** are used in animal science to study the effects of social stress and aggression on animal behavior, physiology, and health. In these models, a dominant animal is paired with a subordinate animal, leading to repeated instances of social defeat for the subordinate animal. This can be achieved in various ways, including using resident-intruder paradigms, tube tests, or other social interaction tests.

Some common examples of social defeat models used in animal science include:

- **Resident-intruder model:** This model involves placing a resident animal in a cage and introducing an intruder animal. The resident animal will typically display aggressive behavior towards the intruder, leading to social defeat for the intruder.

- **Tube test:** In this model, two animals are placed in a tube and forced to interact with each other. The tube restricts the movements of the animals, and the subordinate animal is typically forced to retreat and accept defeat.

- **Chronic social defeat model:** In this model, a subordinate animal is repeatedly exposed to a dominant animal over a prolonged period, leading to chronic social defeat.

These social defeat models are used to study the effects of social stress on a variety of physiological and behavioral outcomes. For example, studies using these models have shown that social defeat can lead to changes in brain function, alterations in the immune system, and changes in the way animals interact with their environment. Additionally, social defeat models can be used to test potential interventions, such as drugs or behavioral therapies, for treating the negative effects of social stress.
