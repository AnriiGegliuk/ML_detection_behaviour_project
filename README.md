## [Social defeat models in animal science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/asj.12809)

**Social defeat models** are used in animal science to study the effects of social stress and aggression on animal behavior, physiology, and health. In these models, a dominant animal is paired with a subordinate animal, leading to repeated instances of social defeat for the subordinate animal. This can be achieved in various ways, including using resident-intruder paradigms, tube tests, or other social interaction tests.

These social defeat models are used to study the effects of social stress on a variety of physiological and behavioral outcomes. For example, studies using these models have shown that social defeat can lead to changes in brain function, alterations in the immune system, and changes in the way animals interact with their environment. Additionally, social defeat models can be used to test potential interventions, such as drugs or behavioral therapies, for treating the negative effects of social stress.

- Identify and track the movement of animals in the videos
- Determine the direction of movement of the animals
